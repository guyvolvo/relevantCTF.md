### **So here are the rules and hints we get from the challenge:**

- Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement, however we ask that you attempt manual exploitation first
- Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
- Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
- Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope
- Find and report ALL vulnerabilities (yes, there is more than one path to root)
- Note - Nothing in this room requires Metasploit
- Writeups will not be accepted for this room.
